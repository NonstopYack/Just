    <p>Oh, her eyes, her eyes
        <br>Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
        <br> Her hair, her hair
        <br> Falls perfectly without her tryin'
        <br>She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
        <br>Yeah, I know, I know
        <br>When I compliment her, she won't believe me
        <br> And it's so, it's so
        <br>Sad to think that she don't see what I see
        <br>But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
        <br>I say
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>When I see your face
        <br>There's not a thing that I would change
        <br> 'Cause you're amazing
        <br>Just the way you are
        <br>And when you smile
        <br>The whole world stops and stares for a while
        <br>'Cause girl, you're amazing
        <br> Just the way you are
        <br>Yeah</p>
        <br>
        <p>Her lips, her lips
            <br>I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
            <br>Her laugh, her laugh
            <br> She hates, but I think it's so sexy
            <br>She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
            <br> Oh, you know, you know
            <br>You know I'd never ask you to change
            <br>If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
            <br>So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
            <br>You know I'll say</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I see your face
               <br> There's not a thing that I would change
               <br>'Cause you're amazing
               <br> Just the way you are
               <br>And when you smile
               <br>The whole world stops and stares for a while
               <br>'Cause girl, you're amazing
               <br>Just the way you are</p>
                <br>
                <p>The way you are
                    <br>The way you are
                    <br> Girl, you're amazing
                    <br>Just the way you are</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I see your face
                        <br>There's not a thing that I would change
                        <br>'Cause you're amazing
                        <br> Just the way you are
                        <br>And when you smile
                        <br>The whole world stops and stares for a while
                        <br>'Cause girl, you're amazing
                        <br>Just the way you are
